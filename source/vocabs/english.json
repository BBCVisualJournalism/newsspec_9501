	"text_article_p1": "NHS England says there are grounds for &quot;cautious optimism&quot;. Why? Because after the problems at the turn of the year when waiting times slumped to their worst levels since the target was brought in a decade ago, the past few weeks show performance has stabilised in A&E units in England.",
	"text_article_p2": "The last week illustrates this perfectly. Visits to A&E rose slightly, but despite this waiting time performance improved - the number of people seen within four hours rose from 92.3% to 92.9%. You would normally expect more patients to put more strain on the system.",
	"text_article_p3": "Of course, the NHS is not out of the woods yet. Any doctor or nurse will tell you this is proving to be one of the most difficult winters for a long time - and not just in England but across the whole UK. It could be quite a while before the target is hit again.",

	"infoboxes_info0": "The figures relate to the trust as a whole rather than individual hospitals. Some trusts have more than one hospital with a major A&E department but NHS England does not break the figures down by hospital.",

	"infoboxes_info2": "The number of people who visit the unit during the week",
	"infoboxes_info3": "These are when patients need to be admitted into the hospital for further treatment. The majority come via A&E, but some also arrive after GP referrals or after outpatient appointments. The figure shown only includes those patients who have been admitted by A&E.",
	"infoboxes_info4": "The number of people who have waited longer than the target of four-hours to be seen or admitted into hospital.",
	"infoboxes_info5": "This is an indication of a long wait for an emergency admission. It measures the time it takes after A&E staff have decided a patient needs to be admitted to hospital to the point at which they are given a bed.",
	"infoboxes_info6": "Ambulances can only leave A&E when they have formally transferred a patient into the care of hospital staff. The NHS is meant to do this within 15 minutes of an ambulance arrival. A queuing ambulance is classed as one that has waited at least 30 minutes.",
	"infoboxes_info7": "Pressure on A&E can affect other parts of the hospital. This measures the number of non-emergency operations cancelled, which includes treatments such as hip and knee replacements.",
	"infoboxes_info8": "Some patients, particularly the frail elderly, can only be discharged when the hospital is satisfied there is the right care in the community, either from social care or the NHS, for them to be properly cared for. This is an indication of how many days have been lost due to patients being kept in hospital when they are ready for discharge because of insufficient services available out of hospital. The figures are calculated by adding together the number of beds blocked each day to create a weekly total.",
	"infoboxes_info9": "Figure is calculated by adding the number of beds unavailable each day due to diarrhoea and vomiting or norovirus-like symptoms over the week.",
